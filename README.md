# üå∏ Feedforward Neural Network for Iris Classification

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and use a **Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)** using **Keras** to classify **Iris flower species** based on four flower measurements.

It is divided into two main parts:

- `ModelTrain.html`: Model creation, training, and saving
- `ModelPredict.html`: Model loading and prediction on new data

## Model Architecture

- Input layer: 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
- Hidden layers: 16, 40, and 10 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output layer: 3 neurons with softmax activation (for 3 classes)

## Training

- Loss function: categorical_crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Epochs: 200
- Batch size: 4
- 80/20 train/test split

## üß† Problem Statement

Given a dataset with 4 features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

...the goal is to classify the input into one of the following species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica
